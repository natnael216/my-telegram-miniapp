  <h1>Newton's Laws of Motion</h1>

  <div class="law">
    <div class="law-title">1. Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia)</div>
    <p>
      An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="law">
    <div class="law-title">2. Newton's Second Law (Law of Acceleration)</div>
    <p>
      The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This is often written as:
      <strong>F = ma</strong>, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="law">
    <div class="law-title">3. Newton's Third Law (Action and Reaction)</div>
    <p>
      For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always occur in pairs.
